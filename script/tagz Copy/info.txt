description = tagz is a set of tags to build interactive environments in Teardown without any coding.

Examle 1: To make a joint act as a motor give a hinge joint the tag "rotate=2" to make it rotate 2 rounds per second clockwise or "rotate=-2.5" to make it rotate 2 and a half rounds per second counter clockwise.

Available tags:
rotate
oscillate
light
explode
delete

If a light have the tag "off" it will start deactivated.
The "oscillate" tag requires that the joint have limits set up.

BUTTONS AND TRIGGERS
